# Sausage Jalapeño and Cheese Kolaches


> **NOTE** This recipe has an overnight rise! 


Inspired by [Bacon, Butter, Cheese, & Garlic](http://baconbuttercheesegarlic.blogspot.com/2014/03/sausage-jalapeno-kolaches.html) and [kitchenDebug](http://kitchendebug.com/Kolache-Trial/).

## Ingredients

- 1 package yeast ([Red Star Platinum](https://redstaryeast.com/platinum/) will change your life)
- 1 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 cup butter
- 3 eggs, divided (2 for batter, 1 for egg wash)
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 cups flour
- 1 package Lil Smokies
- 2 fresh chopped jalapenos
- shredded sharp cheddar cheese

## Directions

**Day 1**

1. Put your yeast and sugar in the bowl of your mixer. Attach your bread hook.
2. Melt butter and milk on the stove with medium-low heat. If it's bubbling, it is past done.
3. Remove butter and milk from heat, let cool about 5 minutes. Whisk in two eggs.
4. Add milk mixture to mixer bowl. Add flour and salt. Turn mixer on low. Stand back to avoid flour clouds.
5. Increase speed until you have a dough ball and the sides of the bowl are clean. Add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time if dough is too sticky.
6. Transfer to bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Let rise on counter 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight (may require 1 punch down).

**Day 2**

7. Remove dough from fridge. Allow dough to warm until dough is not cold to the touch.
8. Preheat oven to 350F.
9. Roll out to even thickness (1/2 inch or smaller). Cut into equal parts.
10. Place cheese, sausage (2ish Lil Smokies), and jalapeños on dough and pull sides together. Create seam along the bottom. 
11. Brush egg wash (add a little water to thin egg) on each kolache.
12. Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until slightly browned.

## Comments

Most recipes suggest greasing the bowl, but I'm concerned that has impacted our seam seals in previous attempts. 

These can be frozen after baking! We usually thaw in the fridge overnight and warm for ~8 min in the toaster oven on reheat (350F).

This can yield about 20-30 kolaches.
