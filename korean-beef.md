> **NOTE**: The rice can be prepared however you would like, following any separate rice recipe. 


Inspired by [Damn Delicious's Korean Beef Bowl](https://damndelicious.net/2013/07/07/korean-beef-bowl/).

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/4 cup soy sauce (reduced soy, if preferred)
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes (or more to taste!)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)

## Directions

1. In bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and ginger.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in large skillet.
3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, approximately a minute.
4. Add ground beef and cook until browned (3-5 minutes); drain.
5. Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until combined; allow to simmer until heated through.
6. Serve immediately with rice, garnishing with green onion and sesame seeds.

## Comments

If you would like a thicker sauce, separate a tablespoon of the soy sauce mixture, stir in your desired amount of cornstarch (between 1 and 3 teaspoons), and then add mixture back to ground beef.
