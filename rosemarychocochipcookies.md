## Recipe Note
* I simply use a fork to mix most of the cookie recipes in this book. True, it takes a little more elbow grease and time to beat the oils and sugars adequately, but for me it’s somehow worth it not to have to break out the hand mixer. If you don’t see the logic in this (because there really isn’t any) then feel free to use your hand mixer!
* I also use a cookie disher, which is a small ice cream scooper. For years I relied on nothing but a tablespoon and my eyeballs to make sure my cookies were the same size, so you can do that, too.
* Make sure that your coconut oil is at room temperature. It shouldn’t be clear and melted, just somewhat creamy without any large lumps.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup refined coconut oil, softened
- 2 tablespoons lightly packed, fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup almond milk (or your favorite non-dairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon ground flax seeds (golden preferred)
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup chocolate semisweet chips

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two large baking sheets.

2. In a large mixing bowl, use a fork to beat together the coconut oil and rosemary, until relatively smooth. Add the sugar and beat for about a minute.

3. Add the non-dairy milk and flax seeds and beat once again, for 30 seconds or so. Mix in the vanilla.

4. Add about half the flour, as well as the salt and baking soda, and mix well. Add the remainder of the flour, along with the chocolate chips, and mix well until it looks like, well, cookie dough.

5. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough onto cookie sheets in rounded spoonfuls. Flatten gently with your hands. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until bottoms are golden brown.

6. Let cool on sheets for 3 minutes or so, then transfer to cooling racks to cool the rest of the way.
