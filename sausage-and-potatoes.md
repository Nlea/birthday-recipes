## Ingredients

- 1 lb of smoked turkey sausage or kielbasa
- 1 large sweet onion, peeled and sliced
- 1 large bell pepper, sliced
- 4-5 medium potatoes russet/red/new/sweet (or a mix of 1 sweet + 3-4 of 1 other)
- 1 tablespoon olive/canola/veg oil
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon [Tony’s](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tony-Chachere-s-Creole-Original-Seasoning-17-Oz/10313896)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- shredded cheese, optional
- minced garlic, optional

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400*F.
1. Line a large baking sheet or 9x13 casserole pan with tin foil, and spray with cooking spray. Set aside.
1. Cut sausage into rounds (and then halves for thorough meaty goodness). Cut the potatoes into small chunks (roughly 1/2 inch). The smaller size helps with cooking time.
1. Slice the onion and bell pepper, then halve.
1. Add the sausage rounds, onions, and potatoes into a large bowl. Drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Toss together with your hands until everything is evenly distributed.
1. Pour this out onto the sheet pan and spread out the sausage and potatoes.
1. Place into the heated oven and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, stirring every 15 minutes or so, until the potatoes are golden brown and tender. Turn off the oven.
1. Scatter the cheese over top of the cooked meat and potatoes, Pop back into the oven a few minutes to melt the cheese. (optional)

## Comments

I sometimes add mushrooms into the mix. Also, you can absolutely do a smaller version of this using only 1/2 of the sausage, 2 nicely sized russets or frozen crinkle fries, a small onion, garlic, and shredded cheese. In this version you instead:

1. Slice the potatoes into nicely sized steak fries. Or grab an oversized serving of the frozen fries. Season and prepare as you normally would. Note: I normally use a cooling rack to elevate my fries so they can cook evenly!
1. While the fries are getting ready, add sautee' your onion and garlic in a bit of oil. Once that's done, add the sliced sausage and let it get a bit crispy.
1. Once the fries are done, remove them from the oven. Place the fries on a nice-sized piece of foil.
1. Add your sausage and onion on top of the fries.
1. Add a lot of shredded cheesy love, and place back in the oven until the cheese is melted.
1. Enjoy!
